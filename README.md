Concerning the crowdfunding data, here are 3 conclusions:
  1)	There are more successes than not!  An average of 57%
  2)	The most common projects are Plays.  About 35%
  3)	There is a strong correlation between successes and % funding.

Limitations:
  1)	Although 1,000 data points is a lot, there are more correlations that can be drawn with more data.  For example, there is a spike in successes mid-year followed by a drop soon after, but it’s really hard to say without more data.  That is one thing I would like to explore given more data points.

Additional tables:
  1)	I would like to chart successes vs total time of campaign to see if there’s any correlation there.  Especially those that start mid-year.
    a.	It doesn’t appear there is any magical campaign time to hit.
  2)	Success % vs spotlight and vs Staff_pick
    a.	Putting these in pivot tables, it appears that there is no success boost if there is a spotlight or staff pick.  
      i.	Spotlight has a 55% success rate
      ii.	Staff_Pick has a 57% success rate

Statistical analysis:
  1)	The mean most likely better summarizes the data, since it is used most often and it is expected.  However, with the variance so high in success, there could be enough outliers to need to use the median.
  2)	There is a higher variability in successful campaigns than in unsuccessful.
